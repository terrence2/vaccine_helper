# Purpose
---
Vaccine Helper is an application that computes a vaccine schedule and captures vaccine
records for adults that need help keeping track of their immunizations, especially for
new vaccines that they didn't get as children, and for boosting vaccines that you don't
normally get after childhood that really should be boosted.

# Tech Stack
---
This application is implemented in the Rust programming language. It is structured as
an eframe app and uses egui to present a user experience that runs both locally
and on the web.

# Linting
---
Prefer to use clippy for linting.

> cargo clippy

# Testing
---
Prefer to use nextest for testing.

> cargo nextest run

# Building
---
Building for native is done as standard for Rust projects.

> cargo build

Building for web is done via trunk, running on a custom port to avoid clashing with other apps.
This will capture the terminal and auto-rebuild on file changes.

> trunk serve -p 8081

# CI/CD
---
CI/CD are handled via github actions. Push to a non-main development branch to run the full CI
suite. Only do this after testing extensively locally, because these runs are quite time consuming.

Once the PR is approved and merged to the main branch, CD will automatically re-test and deploy
the application to the web.
